# Example configuration file for convert_videos
# Copy this file to config.yaml and customize as needed

# Directory to scan for video files
# Can be overridden by command line argument
directory: "/path/to/videos"

# Minimum file size threshold (in bytes)
# Default: 1073741824 (1GB)
# You can use human-readable formats: "1GB", "500MB", "2GB", etc.
min_file_size: "1GB"

# Output format and encoder settings
output:
  # Output container format: mkv, mp4
  format: "mkv"
  
  # Video encoder to use: x265, x265_10bit, or nvenc_hevc (for GPU acceleration)
  # x265: Standard H.265 8-bit encoding (CPU)
  # x265_10bit: H.265 10-bit encoding (CPU, better quality)
  # nvenc_hevc: NVIDIA GPU-accelerated H.265 encoding (requires NVIDIA GPU)
  encoder: "x265_10bit"
  
  # Encoder preset: ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow
  # Faster presets = faster encoding but larger files
  # Slower presets = slower encoding but smaller files
  preset: "medium"
  
  # Quality setting (lower = better quality but larger file)
  # Range: 0-51 for x265, recommended: 20-28
  quality: 24

# Preserve original files after successful conversion
# Default: false (original files are deleted)
preserve_original: false

# Run in loop mode (continuously scan every hour)
# Default: false
loop: false

# Dry run mode (show what would be converted without converting)
# Default: false
dry_run: false
